# Introduction to CSS

## Why do we need CSS?

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's called this because the styling applies to more generic components and cascades into more specific components.

It is a style sheet language which allows programmers to style html pages.

Other style sheets include

- Sass
- Less
- and others
